Please place your logo image file in this directory with the name "logo.png".
It should be a PNG format image with transparent background for best results.
The recommended size is around 240x80 pixels to match the SVG dimensions.

The app has been configured to look for the logo at "/logo.png" in the root public directory.

If you have the image ready, you can:
1. Copy it to the public directory and name it "logo.png"
2. The site will then display your actual logo image instead of the SVG text version.
